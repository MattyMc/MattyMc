### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matt: a full-stack developer and data scientist from Toronto, Canada. When I'm not [messing around in data science](https://twitter.com/MattLovesMath/status/1319702830224150528?s=20), trying new coffee shops, [making silly machines to beat video games](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRcckG77/) or learning [new dances](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRcc97PX/) with my wife, [Pam](https://twitter.com/MattLovesMath/status/1372559030615470082?s=20), I'm likely [working to bootstrap my passion project, Typist](https://twitter.com/MattLovesMath/status/1120658031115755521?s=20).
